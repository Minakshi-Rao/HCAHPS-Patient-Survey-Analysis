# HCAHPS-Patient-Survey-Analysis

I worked as a Data Analyst for the American Hospital Association (AHA). AHA is a national organization that represents hospitals and their patients. My role is to analyze Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey results for the last 9 years (2015 – 2023).

American Hospital Association (AHA) provided datasets to analyse Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey results between 2015 and 2023. The purpose of this project is to provide a standardized survey instrument for measuring patients’ perspectives on hospital care, and one of its three main goals is to establish incentives for hospitals across the country to improve the quality of care being rendered.

# TASK 

* Have hospitals' HCAHPS scores improved over the past 9 years?
* Are there any specific areas where hospitals have made more progress than others?
* Are there any major areas of opportunity remaining?
* What recommendations can you make to hospitals to help them further improve the patient experience?
